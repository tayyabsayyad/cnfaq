6.What is MAC (Medium Access Control) sublayer? 
  The protocols used to determine who goes next on a multiaccess channel belong to a sublayer of the data link 
  layer called the MAC (Medium Access Control) sublayer. 
   
7.The Channel Allocation Problem?
  Channel allocation is a problem to those who use broadcast channel (broadcast channels are sometimes referred to 
  as multiaccess channels or random access channels).
  Key issue is how to determine who gets to use the channel when there is competition for it.  
  The protocols used to determine who goes next on a multiaccess channel belong to a sublayer of the 
  data link layer called the MAC (Medium Access Control) sublayer. 
  
  Static Channel Allocation in LANs and MANs:
  a.For small number of users with fixed demand pattern FDM is a simple and efficient allocation mechanism. 
  b.For large number of users with varying pattern of demand we have following problem: 
  c.If spectrum is divided into N channels and less than  N users are available, then valuable spectrum is wasted. 
  d.If spectrum is divided into N channels and more than  N users are available, then some user are denined channel 
    due to shortage of spectrum. 
  e.The delay faced by the data will be equal to transmission delay + delay for resolving the contention 
    (stations compete with each other to access the medium) + accessing the medium. 
    
    Dynamic Channel Allocation in LANs and MANs:
    Assumptions made : Station Model: There are N independent stations (also called Terminal) 
    (e.g., computers, telephones, etc.) which has a program which generates the frames. Once a frame has been generated,
    the station is blocked and does nothing until the frame has been successfully transmitted.

 9.Aloha?
   ALOHA: 
   a.In the 1970s, Norman Abramson and his colleagues at the University of Hawaii devised a new and elegant method to 
     solve the channel allocation problem. ALOHA in Hawaiian  means “hello”. 
   b.Two versions of ALOHA : pure and slotted. 
   c.They differ with respect to whether time is divided into discrete slots into which all frames must fit. 
   d.Pure ALOHA does not require global time synchronization; slotted ALOHA does.
  
  Pure ALOHA :
  a.Each station sends a frame whenever it has a frame to send. 
  b.However, since there is only one channel to share, there is the possibility of collision between frames from different stations.
  c.We need to resend the frames that have been destroyed during transmission. The pure ALOHA protocol relies on acknowledgments 
   from the receiver.  When a station sends a frame, it expects the receiver to send an acknowledgment. 
   If the acknowledgment does not arrive after a time-out period, the station assumes that the frame (or the acknowledgment) 
   has been destroyed and resends the frame. 
  d.A collision involves two or more stations. If all these stations try to resend their frames after the time-out, 
    the frames will collide again.  Pure ALOHA dictates that each station waits a random amount of time before 
    sending its frame. The randomness will help avoid more collisions. We call this time the back-off time.

  Pure ALOHA vulnerable time = 2 x (Time to transmit frame) Tfr  
  The throughput for pure ALOHA is S =G x e-2G. 
  The maximum throughput =0.184 when G =(1/2). 
  Where G = average number of frames generated by the system during one frame transmission time. 
  Throughput is a measure of how fast we can actually send data through a network.


  A station is allowed to send only at the beginning of the synchronized time slot, if a station misses this moment, 
  it must wait until the beginning of the next time slot. 
  Slotted ALOHA vulnerable time = Tfr 
  The throughput for slotted ALOHA is S =: G x e-G.
  The maximum throughput = 0.368 when G=1.

10. Carrier Sense Multiple Access Protocols?
  Carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) requires that each station first listen to the medium (or check the state of the medium) 
  before sending. In other words, CSMA is based on the principle "sense before transmit" or "listen before talk.
  " The possibility of collision still exists because of propagation delay; when a station sends a frame, it still takes 
  time (although very short) for the first bit to reach every station and for every station to sense it.
  
11.Persistence Methods?
  Three methods have been devised to answer these questions: 
  A. 1-persistent method 
  B. nonpersistent method 
  C. p-persistent method

  1 – Persistent: 
   a.The station finds the line idle, it sends its frame immediately (with probability 1). 
   b.This method has the highest chance of collision because two or more stations may find the line idle and send their 
     frames immediately.

  Non Persistent: 
   a. If a station that has a frame to send it senses the line.  If the line is idle, it sends immediately. 
   b. If the line is not idle, it waits a random amount of time and then senses the line again. 
   c. The nonpersistent approach reduces the chance of collision because it is unlikely that two or more stations
      will wait the same amount of time and retry to send simultaneously. 
   d. However, this method reduces the efficiency of the network because the medium remains idle when there may 
      be stations with frames to send.
      
  P-persistent: 
  The p-persistent method is used if the channel has time slots with a slot duration equal to or greater than 
  the maximum propagation time
  In this method, after the station finds the line idle it follows these steps: 
  1. With probability p, the station sends its frame. 
  2. With probability q = 1 - p, the station waits for the beginning of the next time slot and checks the line again.     
     a. If the line is idle, it goes to step 1.      
     b. If the line is busy, it acts as though a collision has occurred and uses the back-off procedure.
