1. Why do we need network layer ?
This layer is responsible for the addresing the nodes in logial manner . It helps in making the decisions on routing the packets from 
one network to another.

2. How many hosts are possible for Class A,B and C .
Class A: (2^24)-2
Class B: (2^16)-2
Class C: (2^8)-2

3. How many networks are possible for Class A,B and C .
Class A: (2^7)-2    
Class B: (2^14)-2
Class C: (2^21)-2

4. Default subnet mask in Class A,B,C,D.
Class A : 255.0.0.0
Class B : 255.255.0.0
Class C : 255.255.255.0
Class D : 255.255.255.255

5. Which is a static algorithm in which every incoming packet is sent out on every outgoing line except the one it arrives on.
Flooding 

6. Why is User datagram protocol called connectionless?
Because, all UDP packets are treated independently by transport layer. 


7. The 4 byte IP address consists of?
network address and host address

8. In virtual circuit network each packet contains?
  A short VC number


7. Which device works at network layer?
   router
8. how many routing protocols are present in Network layer?
