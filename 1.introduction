1. What is Computer Network ? 
Computer Network is collection of computers connected together for exchanging information. 

2. Why we need computer network?
Computer network help the user to share the resources and in communication. It useful for file sharing , communication ,
application sharing , lan gaming and many more.

3. What are types of the computer network ?
    Hint LAN, MAN, WAN
    
4. What are the types of data flows in computer ?
     Simplex :- Communication is unidirectional
     Half Duplex :- Each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time
     Full Duplex :- Both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously

5. What are the various network topologies ? 

    1) Bus Network topology: In the bus network topology, every workstation is connected to a main cable called the bus.
    2) Mesh Network topology: -> The mesh network topology employs either of two schemes, called full mesh and partial mesh. 
                              ->In the full mesh topology, each workstation is connected directly to each of the others. 
                              ->In the partial mesh topology, some workstations are connected to all the others, and some are connected 
                                 only to those other nodes with which they exchange the most data.
    3) Ring Network topology: In the ring network topology, the workstations are connected in a closed loop configuration.
    4) Tree Network topology: The tree network topology uses two or more star networks connected together.
                              The central computers of the star networks are connected to a main bus. 
    5) STAR Topology: In this type of topology all the computers are connected to a single hub through a cable. 
                     This hub is the central node and all others nodes are connected to the central node.
    6) HYBRID Topology: It is two different types of topologies which is a mixture of two or more topologies.

  The Internet, sometimes called simply "the Net," is a worldwide system of computer networks.a network of networks in which users 
       at any one computer can, if they have permission, get information from any other computer.

    a)Bus topology consists of one main cable to which all nodes are connected.

11. What is a node?
Ans.    A node refers to a point or joint where a connection takes place. 
        It can be computer or device that is part of a network. 
        Two or more nodes are needed in order to form a network connection.
        
12.  What are routers?
Ans.    Routers can connect two or more network segments. These are intelligent network devices that store information 
        in its routing table such as paths, hops and bottlenecks. 
        With this info, they are able to determine the best path for data transfer. Routers operate at the OSI Network Layer.
        
13. Name the types of reference models.
    a)OSI Reference model (Open Systems interconnection).
    b)TCP/IP Reference model.
    
14. What are protocols?
    Protocol is a standard used to define a method of exchanging data over a computer network.
    For example : TCP, IP, UDP, POP, SMTP, HTTP, and FTP 


15. Function of OSI Model?

    Layer 7: The application layer. This is the layer at which communication partners are identified (Is there someone 
        to talk to?), network capacity is assessed (Will the network let me talk to them right now?), and that creates a 
        thing to send or opens the thing received.  (This layer is not the application itself, it is the set of services 
        an application should be able to make use of directly, although some applications may perform application layer 
        functions.)
    
    Layer 6: The presentation layer. This layer is usually part of an operating system (OS) and converts incoming and 
        outgoing data from one presentation format to another (for example, from clear text to encrypted text at one 
        end and back to clear text at the other).

    Layer 5: The session layer. This layer sets up, coordinates and terminates conversations. Services include 
        authentication and reconnection after an interruption. On the Internet, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and 
        User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provide these services for most applications.

    Layer 4: The transport layer. This layer manages packetization of data, then the delivery of the packets, including 
        checking for errors in the data once it arrives. On the Internet, TCP and UDP provide these services for most 
        applications as well.

    Layer 3: The network layer. This layer handles the addressing and routing of the data (sending it in the right direction 
        to the right destination on outgoing transmissions and receiving incoming transmissions at the packet level). IP is the 
        network layer for the Internet.

    Layer 2: The data-link layer. This layer sets up links across the physical network, putting packets into network frames. 
        This layer has two sub-layers, the Logical Link Control Layer and the Media Access Control Layer. Ethernet is the main 
        data link layer in use.

    Layer 1: The physical layer. This layer conveys the bit stream through the network at the electrical, optical or 
        radio level. It provides the hardware means of sending and receiving data on a carrier networ

16. Expand the acronym MAC.
Ans. Media Access Control

17. Expand the acronym LAN.
Ans. Local Area Network


18. Expand the acronym WAN.
Ans. Wide Area Network

19. What is meant by RIP?
->RIP short for Routing Information Protocol is used by routers to send data from one network to another.
  It efficiently manages routing data by broadcasting its routing table to all other routers within the network.

20. What does 10Base-T mean?
->The 10 refers to the data transfer rate, in this case is 10Mbps. The word Base refers to base band, as oppose to broad band. T means twisted pair, which is the cable used for that network.
